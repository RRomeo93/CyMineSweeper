Bonjour merci d'avoir téléchargé le démineur de Samuel et Nathan à CY TECH 
GROUPE 7 PRE ING 1 MI




Instructions for use: 
 
- To launch it you have to open your terminal and place yourself at the place of the file.
 	Then you have to do this command
 	"make"
 	
- When you have found a bomb it is imperative to put a flag on it. 
	
- The game takes into account if you make a mistake on the input.

- For the makefile it compiles and runs the exec and then deletes right after the exec.
	(Don't worry we don't delete your hard drive)
	
- It is also possible to choose a custom tray size. 
       So we chose between 6 and 32. We thought that after that it was too big.
       If you have chosen a large size and the display is not straight/clean
       You have to enlarge the terminal in full screen.
       
       
       


Notice: 
	For the recursive function we could not do better than 400 lines sorry :(
	The code is commented at the beginning of each function.
	
	
	
	
	
Bonus : The game is colored/ and the user can choose a custom size for the board.

Possible additions in the future: 
Improve the score code, it doesn't write in the .txt
Make a graphical interface via SDL library
